# foodResto
This is a react native complete app that will run on android and iphone(iOS)

It displays a search bar and restaurants. you can search for restaurant related things like, name, cuisine, dishes, etc

it will also display the rating, no of reviews and images of the restaurant.

It uses The Zomato Api, so which ever country Zomato exists, it will give relevant results. 

INITIAL SETUP : 

Install Node JS and React Native. 

To install React Native 

Install expo or react native Cli. https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup. (remember you are not creating a new project here, 
you are running a existing one. so follow the steps related to that.)

Run npm install in your command prompt or Terminal wherever your npm commmad works. https://www.sitepoint.com/npm-guide/

Above step will install all dependencies for this project. 

if npm command is not running then there is some issues that you would need to fix with node Js. it will take some time to search online and fix the npm/ node commands.

Have patience. it might take 2days to a week to finally fix npm, react native and the code to run. I repeat, Have patience and keep at it. 

Feel free to reach me ptpmashish@gmail.com or whatsapp 7893332334 if you are facing any issues. 

Happy coding!
